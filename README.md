# Cyber Threat Intelligence Feeds

There are many "Cyber threat Intelligence" feeds that help Blue Teams to block and monitor Bots activities under control.
I've been investigating regularly to collect and detect malicious scanners and individuals who are trying to find vulnrabiliteis and try to hack them.
If you are interested in "Cyber threat Intelligence" let me know to get to know each other.
Best regards,
